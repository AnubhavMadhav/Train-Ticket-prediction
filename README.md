# Train-Ticket-prediction
Machine Learning Project where we predicted whether an IRCTC customer will pass through a wait-list on specific train routes. Indian Railways get a lot of bookings, so they run a wait-list on train tickets after all the seats have been booked. It's hard to know as a customer whether you will get the ticket or not.
